P4 - Battle of the Plates Computer Prototype
BattleOfThePlates.html

This web app provides a high fidelity in look, medium fidelity in breadth,
and mixed fidelity in depth computer prototype of Battle of the Plates.
Our vertical prototype will be the app's feature to track meal data.

This file is a documentation of all the features on our web app, with the working not non-working aspects of our app highlighted. 

Home
	> Everything we wanted to implement is working 
	> The interactive plate and cup are clickable so users can record data into food groups
	> More Info: when users click this button, they are directed to the selected food group’s corresponding more info page. Here, the daily intake progress bar also updates based on what the user has recorded on the plate.

Profile 
	> Working:  
		> Edit button: users can access it, but none of the information updates onto the user’s profile.   
		> Help button 
		> Stats: all the tabs are working and users can sort through daily, weekly, and monthly data 
		> Personal Goals:  
			> Working: 
				You can create and add new goals  
				You can delete goals, including newly added goals
			> Not working:  
				Newly created goals cannot be checked (but they can be deleted) 
				All, Current, and Complete buttons do not filter goals

Challenge

Friends
	> We had an issue with the data theme swatches; the buttons that lead to friend profiles should be white. All other features are working.
